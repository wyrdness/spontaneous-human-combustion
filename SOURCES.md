## Notes on Source Evaluation

When researching SHC:

1. **Prioritize forensic science sources** over paranormal literature
2. **Check dates**: Pre-1998 sources lack wick effect understanding
3. **Consider author credentials**: Forensic scientists vs. paranormal researchers
4. **Look for experimental evidence** rather than anecdotal cases
5. **Distinguish**: Popular culture portrayals vs. scientific analysis

**Scientific Consensus**: All documented SHC cases explained by wick effect with external ignition sources. No peer-reviewed scientific evidence supports paranormal spontaneous combustion.
