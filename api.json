      "full": "Spontaneous Human Combustion (SHC) refers to reported cases where human bodies have allegedly burned without an apparent external ignition source. Characteristic features include severe burning of the torso, often reducing it to ash, while extremities (hands, feet, lower legs) remain relatively intact. The surrounding environment typically shows minimal fire damage. Documented cases span from the 1600s to present, though modern forensic science largely attributes these incidents to the 'wick effect' - a phenomenon where an external ignition source (cigarette, candle, fireplace) ignites clothing which then acts as a wick, slowly burning body fat as fuel. Victims are typically elderly, alone, near potential ignition sources, and often under the influence of alcohol. While the phenomenon captured public imagination through literature and media, scientific consensus holds that all documented cases can be explained through conventional fire dynamics."
